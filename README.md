# Data-Analysis-on-Airline-Data
## Overview
I worked assuming the role of a consultant for Southeast Airlines. The dataset contains summaries of air travel within the U.S, one row per trip. The focus of the data analysis project is to provide notions and directions to Southeast Airlines so that they can improve their profit and consumer satisfaction. Concrete analysis of the airlines' data helps generate some useful insights into customers mindsets which can be used by the Airlines to take better business decisions and improve customer service. To do so, I conducted Linear Regression for feature selection, Association Rule Mining for to discover variables causing low satisfaction and SVM for classification. I also carried out sentiment analysis on the comments of the Detractors (users rating 6 and below) to know the frequently used words.

## Recommendations
•	Southeast Airlines should cancel the contract with Flyfast Airways or should reduce the flight frequency associated with them.
•	Airline should provide free lounge access to customers when the flight delays.
•	Provide wheelchairs/escort vehicle and personnel to help the senior citizens.
•	Provide teenagers with some goodies and entertainment services with high speed WiFi.
•	Female customers should be given more preferences for window seat.
•	Give customers with blue airline status some incentive points to upgrade their airline status.
•	Provide customers making personal trips with family plan packages.
•	Provide economy class customers with better leg space and with occasional upgrades in the class.
•	Airline should provide discounts to customers when the prices are high.
